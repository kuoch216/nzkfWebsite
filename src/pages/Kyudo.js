        Kyudo Kyudo, the way of the Bow, is one of the ancient martial arts of
        Japan. Kyudo is not merely shooting an arrow at a target. It is a way of
        life, a journey, a journey of pursuing the truth, the goodness and the
        beauty in life. Unlike western archery, this is not a competitive sport
        against others. The competition is with oneâ€™s inner self to harness the
        mind and to master the technique. Why do Kyudo? Kyudo is an excellent
        way to achieve physical, mental and spiritual well-being. It helps to
        improve mind-body coordination, posture, balance, muscle tone and
        general physical fitness. Even more importantly, it gives you a sense of
        joy and a feeling of accomplishment. It shows you the way to
        mindfulness. Kyudo is one of the most prestigious and respected martial
        art forms in Japan and around the world, practiced by many as a method
        of physical, moral and spiritual development. How will I be taught? The
        atmosphere in the dojo is one of friendship, togetherness and mutual
        respect. We have students from all walks of life, male and female. Some
        have been practicing Kyudo with us for more than 10 years, others are
        only just starting. Our ways are informal. Traditional courtesies,
        etiquette and cultural values are respected and encouraged.
