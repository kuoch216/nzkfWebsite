        The New Zealand Kyudo Federation (NZKF) promotes the practice and
        teaching of traditional Kyudo - the art of the Japanese bow - in New
        Zealand. The organisation represents New Zealandâ€™s national charter in
        the All Nippon Kyudo Federation (ANKF) and the International Kyudo
        Federation (IKYF). The NZKF is the governing body for ANKF kyudo in New
        Zealand, and aims to assist local groups in developing kyudo in both
        North and South Islands. The NZKF organises annual seminars for its
        members, usually held in Auckland. Our members also take part in
        international seminars held in Japan, and may take examinations for
        dan-ranking (issued by the All Nippon Kyudo Federation). The NZKF is a
        non-profit voluntary organisation, governed by an elected committee. The
        practice of kyudo is supervised by a technical committee, composed of
        those members with the highest grading and experience in kyudo. Clubs
        (dojo) in New Zealand are established and given recognition by the NZKF
        and are under its supervision. Each dojo leader should be a graded
        person with appropriate experience to teach kyudo safely.
